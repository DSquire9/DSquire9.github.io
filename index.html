            <p>I'm Dan Squire and I am a rising senior at the Rochester Institute of Technology going for my bachelors in Game Design & Development with an Immersion in Mathematics.
                When I'm not in classes or at work I am honing my skills as a programmer to become a better developer. 
                During my off time I also play competetive Hearthstone and am the manager of the RIT Esports Heartstone team, as well as the captain of the team that most recently won the national collegiate championships.
                My main languages are C#, C++, and JavaScript, and I also have some experience with Visual Basic and SQL.
